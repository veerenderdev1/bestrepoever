"CHAN-694"
1. A new field "Total 4-week revenue" in customer detail on customer level in SF.
2. The field should be sum of values of 4-week revenue amounts of opportunities in 52-installed stage.
3. This field should auto calculate whenever a opp changes stage to 52-installed from its previous stage by adding up amounts 
and also deduct an opp 4-week revenue field amount from this total if that opp moves to 60-closed.

Created the "Total 4-week revenue" RollUp Summary Field on Customer.
This field will automatically calculate Recurring 4 week revenue from Opportunities when the Opportunity stage is equal to '52-installed'.
The revenue value will be deducted when the opportunity stage is moved to '60-closed'.

Done Functional testing with test data, working fine.
